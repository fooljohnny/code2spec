# code2spec
Code2Spec is an open-source repository intelligence tool that converts Java codebases into structured, machine-readable API specifications.

Instead of relying on manually maintained documentation, Code2Spec analyzes source code through AST parsing and semantic extraction to automatically generate:

* REST endpoint definitions
* Request and response schemas
* Error code mappings
* Dependency relationships
* Version-aware interface metadata

The generated artifacts can be exported as OpenAPI, JSON schema, Markdown, or structured knowledge objects ready for search, automation, and AI-powered applications.

Code2Spec is designed for teams who want:

* Documentation that stays in sync with code
* Faster onboarding for developers and integrators
* Reliable API discovery across large repositories
* A clean knowledge foundation for AI assistants and RAG systems

The project is language-extensible and aims to support multiple backends beyond Java in future releases.
Code is the source of truth. Code2Spec turns it into structured knowledge.
